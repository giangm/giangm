ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, my name is Minh Giang.

ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently attending Sheridan College to pursue a degree in 
Applied Information Science, and anticipating to graduate in 2023.

ðŸ’» I have participated in multiple CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions including 
DTCC CTF 2020, Queen's CTF, BrixelCTF 2020, magpieCTF 2021, UTCTF 2021, 
ISSessionsCTF 2021, UTM CTF 2021, and many more. 
Through these events, I was able to expand my knowledge in various categories such as exploitation,
web security, cryptography, digital forensics, reverse-engineering, reconnaissance, OSINT, and steganography. 
I have volunteered as a competition judge during Trace Labâ€™s Global OSINT Search Party CTF, mentoring participants 
and auditing flag submissions. I competed in the CyberSci Regionals 2021 and C3X2021 competitions, representing Sheridan College, 
and placed 2nd and 3rd, respectively.

Currently, I am one of the executives of ISSessions Cybersecurity Club that contains over 500 motivated members. 
Feel free to contact me if youâ€™re interested in delivering a talk related to cybersecurity to the community or simply 
interested in joining the community. With that being said, Iâ€™m also looking for more opportunities where I can participate 
in and build my skillset.

ðŸ—“ In terms of my future, my goal is to acquire the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification 
and become a professional penetration tester. I am also seeking for a co-op/internship opportunity in cyber security 
for the summer of 2022.

ðŸŽ® Besides school, I spend a lot of my free time on TryHackMe to advance my skills and knowledge further, although 
I also enjoy playing video games and watching movies.
